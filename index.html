                    Nice to meet you! I am a freshman majoring in Computer
                    Science at The University of Texas at Austin. I am a part of
                    the Freshman Research Initative and I will be going to be
                    focusing on robot learning this semester (really cool
                    stuff)! When you don't see me hunched like a shrimp over my
                    laptop you will probably catch me in the gym or binging a
                    show!

                                Assignment for my Introduction to Programming
                                class where I programmed a piano that can be
                                played from a user's qwerty keyboard. Java was
                                used to develop this program. This was a very fun project as the end result of this program is something more tangible and visually appealing than past projects. However, Due to UT's Academic
                                Honesty Policy, I cannot post the code developed for this program.

                                    This was a team project where we were free to develop a mobile app in CodeHS using React Native. My partner and I decided to create a grocery list app where the user can input their budget, what items they are buying, how many and how much of each item, and if their purchase will be below their budget. This is meant to prepare and inform the user before and during grocery shopping. This project highlighted the engineering process and the  ways developers test and create applications. This is a quick demo of the app:

                                This is a project I worked on in my Web
                                Development class where we were alllowed
                                any and all form of creative freedom to create a
                                game of our choosing. The game I created is
                                called Eliza's Elixirs and it is
                                meant for children to use their memorization
                                skills to remember
                                the ingredients needed in order to make
                                different potions. This game was created in
                                GDevelop. This is a quick demo of the game, there are other characters but due to space, there will only be one character in the demo.
